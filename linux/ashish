PIPE AND REDDIRECTION
before we get down to the detail of the shell programming,we need to say a little about how input and output of linux programm (not just shell programming )can be redirected.
REDIRECTION
you may already be familiar with some redirection ,such as
$ ls -l | ashish 
which saves the output of ls command into a file called ashish
