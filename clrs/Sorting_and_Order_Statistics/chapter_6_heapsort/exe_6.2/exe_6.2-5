problem

The code for M AX -H EAPIFY is quite efficient in terms of constant factors, except
possibly for the recursive call in line 10, which might cause some compilers to
produce inefficient code. Write an efficient M AX -H EAPIFY that uses an iterative
control construct (a loop) instead of recursion.
